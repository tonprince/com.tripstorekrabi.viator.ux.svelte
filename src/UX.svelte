      <h3>Why this UX Design Proposal</h3>
      <div>
        After a few years working with Viator and Tripadvisor, we wanted to give
        some important feedbacks from the supplier's point of view. Therefore we

        for many operators in the tourism field which face the same bottlenecks
        and issues when creating and maintaining new products on the Viator
        supplier website. Due to the more intense competition from other OTAs
        such as GetYourGuide, Expedia, Klook etc, there is a huge need to
        optimize the product UI appearance on Viator and Tripadvisor website to
        have an outstanding experience.
